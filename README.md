Non-WIMP project, 'Hands-Free Paint'

Small non-WIMP interface that lets you paint a canvas moving an object of a given
color.
Built with tracking.js and HTML5 Canvas.

1. Pick one of the 3 colors allowed by the buttons as your *object* color 
  * these are Unicode emojis, which might not be supported by all systems (our bad!).
2. Make sure you're in an evenly lit environment with a neutral background.
3. Hold an object of the selected color and move it in front of your camera. 
4. Use the RGB color selector for your *drawing* color.
5. Draw your abstract piece on the HTML5 Canvas ðŸ˜³.
